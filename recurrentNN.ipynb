We just need to add an extra dimension to the input shape with the number of characters.\n",

Just as with the input, this is another more convenient way of doing what we were already doing by defining and re-using layers. Wrapping a layer with \"TimeDistributed\" basically says \"apply this to every timestep in the array\". Like the RNN, it expects (and returns) a 3-dimensional array. The reshape operation is the same story, we just add another dimension to it. The RNN layer itself is very straightforward."

        "The good news is that this capability is built into Keras's recurrent layers, we just need to set a flag to true! The bad news is that we need to re-think how the data is structured. Stateful models require 1) a fixed batch size, which is specified in the model input, and 2) that each batch be a \"slice\" of sequences such that the next batch contains the next part of each sequence. In other words, we need to split up our data (which is one long continuous stream of text) into n chunks of equal-length streams of text, where n is the batch size. Then, we need to carve up these n chunks into sequences of length 8 (which is the sequence length the model looks at) with the following character in each sequence being the target (the thing we're predicting).\n",

The input specifies \"batch_shape\" and has three dimensions (this is a hard requirement to use stateful RNNs in Keras, and gets quite annoying during inference time). We've set \"return_sequences\" to true, which changes the shape that the RNN returns and gives us an output for each step in the sequence. We've set \"stateful\" to true, the motivation for which was already discussed. Finally, we've wrapped the last dense layer with \"TimeDistributed\".
